# A Complete Intro to React

Welcome to a complete intro to React! The site actual workshop material for this repo can be found [here][gh-page]. On the master branch you will find the completed project. On the start branch you will find the barebones boilerplate of the project designed to help you get started.

## Personal Notes (Corentin)

### Prettier <https://prettier.io/>
Useful auto-formating tool, integrates nicely with most code editor (Webstorm, Atom, Sublime etc...) and ESLint.

### React router <https://reacttraining.com/react-router/>
Routing library to build single app with React (now working with React Native too).\
2 Routing strategies available on browser:
 1. HashRouter: use # in URL (http://toto#mypage)
 2. BrowserRouter: Use HTML5 History API to write nice looking URL (http://toto/mypage), if you use it with webpack-dev-server don't forget to add `historyApiFallback: true` to your config.

## Contributing

Please contribute, file issues, and make PRs. More than anything I'm sure there are typos abounding.
